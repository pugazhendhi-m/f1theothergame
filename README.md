# F1 Reaction Game üèéÔ∏è

A high-precision reaction time racing game built for Reddit using Devvit. Test your reflexes and racing skills as you navigate a 1km track with strategic brake and acceleration zones that require split-second timing to master.

## What is F1 Reaction Game?

F1 Reaction Game is an innovative skill-based racing experience where players control a Formula 1 car not through traditional steering, but through perfectly timed reactions to visual cues. As your car speeds along a predetermined track, you must react to brake points and acceleration zones that appear at specific distances, pressing the correct controls at precisely the right moment to optimize your speed and achieve the fastest possible race time.

The game combines the thrill of Formula 1 racing with the precision of reaction time challenges, creating a unique gaming experience that rewards both quick reflexes and strategic timing. Your car automatically moves forward at a base speed of 50 m/s, but strategic use of brake and acceleration controls at the right moments can significantly improve your lap time.

### How It Works

Your Formula 1 car (üèéÔ∏è) automatically races along a 1000-meter track at a base speed of 50 m/s. The track features 8 strategic checkpoints:

- **4 Brake Points** at 200m, 400m, 700m, and 900m - activate the left control (üõë)
- **4 Acceleration Points** at 100m, 350m, 600m, and 850m - activate the right control (‚ö°)

When your car reaches these checkpoints, the corresponding control button turns from red (inactive) to green (active) for exactly 2 seconds. During this green window, pressing the correct control gives you a speed boost. Press it during the red state, and you'll get a speed penalty instead!

## What Makes This Game Unique?

- Use **"RESTART RACE"** during the race to abandon current attempt and start over
- Race times are recorded with 0.1ms precision for competitive comparison

### Advanced Strategies

#### **Checkpoint Memorization**
Learn the exact sequence to anticipate controls:
1. **100m**: Acceleration (right control) - First boost opportunity
2. **200m**: Brake (left control) - First brake zone
3. **350m**: Acceleration (right control) - Mid-track boost
4. **400m**: Brake (left control) - Mid-track brake zone
5. **600m**: Acceleration (right control) - Late-race boost
6. **700m**: Brake (left control) - Late-race brake zone
7. **850m**: Acceleration (right control) - Final boost opportunity
8. **900m**: Brake (left control) - Final brake zone

#### **Reaction Time Optimization**
- **Watch the track visualization** to see upcoming checkpoint markers
- **Keep fingers ready** on A/D keys or thumbs positioned over buttons
- **React to color change and "PRESS NOW!" text**, not distance numbers
- **Practice the rhythm** - checkpoints follow a predictable alternating pattern
- **Use peripheral vision** to watch for control state changes while monitoring your progress
